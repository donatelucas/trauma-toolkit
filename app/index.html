      <div class="about-content">
        <p> Trauma Toolkit is a website developed to help victims of traumatizing
          experiences find peace and shelter. In a world that stigmatizes sexual
          assault victims, a place of haven can be a way to find help both mentally
          and physically. We aim to provide victims of these events with the tools
          and resources to find help and receive any aid necessary to help them
          continue their day to day lives. While we understand that we cannot
          solve the issue, we hope to bring continual awareness to the fact that
          sexual assault happens daily, and we can do our best to provide assistance.
        </p>
        <p> Currently, we cover the subjects of sexual abuse and rape. While they
          may seem the same, diving into our content shows just how nuanced these
          subjects can be. Our eventual aim is to provide resources and assistance
          to those that face all traumatic events, not just the two listed above.
        </p>
        <p> If you have come here not as a victim but as an ally, please review
          the information to provide assistance to those around you that may have
          experienced a traumatic event so that they can find help.
        </p>
        <p>In case of emergency, call 911.</p>
